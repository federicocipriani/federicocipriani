# Hello 👨🏼‍💻!

I'm Federico, both an aerospace engineer who loves coding and an **iOS developer** currently living in the Germany.

I played around with many things before ending up in iOS development (data science, ethical hacking, web development), but I finally found my Ikigai.

You can find my old repositories when I was learning and developing my HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReactJS skills, but also the new projects I am developing in SwiftUI.
